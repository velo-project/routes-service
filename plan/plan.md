# Development Plan: Routes Service

This document outlines the development plan for the Routes Service.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality

- **Authentication and Authorization:**
  - [x] Implement JWT-based authentication.
  - [x] Create middleware for validating JWT tokens.
  - [ ] Implement authorization checks for all endpoints.

- **Track Management (CRUD):**
  - [x] Create Track (already implemented)
  - [x] Read Tracks by User ID
  - [ ] Delete Track

- **Testing:**
  - [ ] Set up a testing framework (e.g., `testify`).
  - [ ] Write unit tests for all services.
  - [ ] Write integration tests for the database adapters.
  - [ ] Write E2E tests for the API endpoints.

## Phase 2: Enhancements

- **API Improvements:**
  - [ ] Implement pagination for listing tracks.
  - [ ] Add filtering and sorting capabilities to the track list endpoint.
  - [ ] Implement HATEOAS for the API responses.

- **User Integration:**
  - [ ] Add more gRPC calls to the user service (e.g., get user profile).
  - [ ] Implement a service to handle user-related business logic.

- **Logging and Monitoring:**
  - [ ] Implement structured logging (e.g., using `zerolog` or `zap`).
  - [ ] Add a health check endpoint.
  - [ ] Add Prometheus metrics for monitoring.

## Phase 3: Production Readiness

- **Configuration:**
  - [ ] Implement configuration management using a library like Viper.
  - [x] Externalize all configuration values (e.g., database connection string, JWT secret).

- **CI/CD:**
  - [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
  - [ ] Automate the building, testing, and deployment of the service.

- **API Documentation:**
  - [ ] Generate API documentation using a tool like Swagger.
